<h3 class="section-title">Terms of Use</h3>
<textarea style="width:100%;height:300px;padding:5px;">
1. These terms apply to your use of any product and/or service (the "Program") offer by USGrants and its affiliates.

8. Refunds or cancelled orders will also reflect on your account as negative adjustments.

9. To earn Commission, you must promote your unique affiliate URL. If you don't include your affiliate ID in the URL string, your traffic will not be tracked properly and you will not earn Commission on qualified transactions.

10. Cookies on web browsers must be enabled in order for the tracking to work properly. If you promote your unique affiliate URL to users who have cookies disabled on their web browsers, you will not earn Commission on qualified transactions.

Your PayPal account must be able to accept international money transfers from both Canada and United States.

12. USGrants pays its Members accrued Commission every month in United States dollars (USD) via PayPal. Within the first week of every month, the total earned for the previous month will be calculated and associated with a Payout Record. Then each Payout Record will be processed 2-3 weeks from the record creation date. For example, for Commission earned in January, a Payout Record will be generated within the first week of February, and the Payout Record for January will be processed before the end of February.

13. Each Payout Record will contain both positive transactions on verified orders, and negative transactions on refunds and cancelled orders.

Any failure to comply with our Terms, any fraud or abuse relating to the accrual or receipt of Commission, or any misrepresentation of any information furnished to USGrants or its affiliates may result in the termination of your account, participation in the Program, and forfeiture of your accrued Commission.

19. The determination of whether or not a transaction made through a USGrants merchant qualifies for Commission is at the sole discretion of USGrants. USGrants reserves the right to cancel the Commission associated with any transaction.
